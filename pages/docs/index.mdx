# Introduction


TailwindCSS is an excellent utility-first CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-defined CSS classes for quickly building responsive, well-designed websites. The framework's utility-first approach allows for rapid development and a more consistent design across a project, but it can also lead to messy class names and a cluttered HTML structure. This is especially true when working on large projects with multiple developers where class naming conventions may not be consistent. However, with proper organization and planning, the benefits of using TailwindCSS can outweigh any potential downsides.


**Tailwind variants** aims to help developers create more consistent and readable tailwind class names while also providing a way to apply variants and compoundVariants to multiple elements at the same time.

### What?


Imagine you need to create a button with a blue background and white text. It's easy right? Probably you would do something like this:


```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Button
</button>
```

<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Button
</button>

Now the button also needs to have a different variation with a flat background

```html
<button class="bg-blue-200 text-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-800 dark:hover:bg-blue-900 font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Button
</button>
```

<button class="bg-blue-100 text-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-800 dark:hover:bg-blue-900 font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Button
</button>

What if we need the same button but with a different size and a different color?, would you do something like this?

```html
<button class="bg-{{ color }}-200  text-{{ color }}-500 ...">...</button>
```

In that way Tailwind will not generate those classes, Read more about it [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names).



let's try to write it using React:

```jsx

function Button({ size, color }) {
// colors = ['blue', 'purple', 'yellow', 'red']
// size = ['xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl']
 const colorVariants = {




   
  }


 
}
```




It easily becomes a mess of classes right?, and it's hard to keep track of what's going on. With Tailwind Variants, you can do this: */}
